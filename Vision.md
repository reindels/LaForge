##The Dyslexic Games

The most common language-based disability is in fact dyslexia and currently there is no easy way to test for it without the help of a professional.

The cost of paying for an actual professional to administer then look over a test can be too expensive for some, but a free to use website can be the middle ground for those who can not afford a real person. An example from this was found from the website forum when a user wrote My boy was 15 when I finally could take him to a neuro-psychologist. $800.00 was hard for my family. To cut the cost this website will be able to test for dyslexia and also administer "game" like scenarios to help anyone who has a learning disability. They can take their time and do it at their own pace allowing flexibility as well as a cheap alternative to the traditional professional with strict hours.

To solve this problem I hope that their will be a website where parents and other guardians can bring their children too so they can test for dyslexia and play games. While this method will never be as effective as having a professional deliver a test, the website is a cost effective way for those who do not have means to pay for a professional. If diagnosed this website will allow students to play “games” as they are, to improve their reading, writing, and spelling problems.
